 put together a list of useful Python snippets that have saved me tons of time and I hope they can save you some time as well. Most of these snippets came out of searching for solutions and finding blog posts and StackOverflow answers addressing similar problems. All the snippets below have been tested for Python 3.
Calling an External Command in Python

There are times when you need to call an external command via the shell or command prompt and Python makes this quite easy via the subprocess module.

To simply run a command:

import subprocess
subprocess.call(['mkdir', 'empty_folder'])

If you want to run a command and get it's resulting output:

import subprocess
output = subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l'])

It's important to note that the above calls are blocking.

If you are trying to run commands that are built into the shell such as cd or dir, you will need to specify the shell=True flag:

import subprocess
output = subprocess.call(['cd', '/'], shell=True)

For more advanced use cases, you can use the Popen constructor.

Python 3.5 introduced a new run function which is used in a very similiar manner to call and check_output. If you're using version 3.5 or greater, have a look at the run documentation which has some useful examples. Otherwise, if you're using a version of Python prior to 3.5 or you would like to maintain backwards compatibility, the call and check_output snippets above are your safest and simplest choice.
Pretty Printing

You can make your shell output more readable when developing by using the pprint module as a replacement for the standard print function. This makes dictionaries and nested objects printed to the shell a lot easier to read.

import pprint as pp
animals = [{'animal': 'dog', 'legs': 4, 'breeds': ['Border Collie', 'Pit Bull', 'Huskie']}, {'animal': 'cat', 'legs': 4, 'breeds': ['Siamese', 'Persian', 'Sphynx']}]
pp.pprint(animals, width=1)

The width parameter specifies the maximum number of characters on a single line. Setting the width to 1 ensures that the dictionary is printed on separate lines.
Grouping Data by Attributes

Assume you queried a database and got back data that looks like so:

data = [
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Roxie', 'age': 5},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Zeus', 'age': 6},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Spike', 'age': 9},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Scooby', 'age': 7},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Fluffy', 'age': 3},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Oreo', 'age': 5},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Bella', 'age': 4}   
    ]

You want to group the data by the type of animal to return a list of dogs and a list cats. Thankfully, Python's itertools has a groupby function that allows you to do this easily:

from itertools import groupby

data = [
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Roxie', 'age': 5},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Zeus', 'age': 6},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Spike', 'age': 9},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Scooby', 'age': 7},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Fluffy', 'age': 3},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Oreo', 'age': 5},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Bella', 'age': 4}   
    ]

for key, group in groupby(data, lambda x: x['animal']):
    for thing in group:
        print(thing['name'] + " is a " + key)

The output you get is:

Roxie is a dog
Zeus is a dog
Spike is a dog
Scooby is a dog
Fluffy is a cat
Oreo is a cat
Bella is a cat

groupby() takes 2 arguments: 1. the data we want to group, in this case a list of dictionaries 2. the function to group by: - lambda x: x['animal'] is telling the groupby function to group the data by the type of animal in each dictionary

We can now easily construct a list of dogs and a list of cats using a list comprehension:

from itertools import groupby
import pprint as pp

data = [
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Roxie', 'age': 5},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Zeus', 'age': 6},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Spike', 'age': 9},
    {'animal': 'dog', 'name': 'Scooby', 'age': 7},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Fluffy', 'age': 3},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Oreo', 'age': 5},
    {'animal': 'cat', 'name': 'Bella', 'age': 4}   
    ]

grouped_data = {}

for key, group in groupby(data, lambda x: x['animal']):
    grouped_data[key] = [thing['name'] for thing in group]

pp.pprint(grouped_data)

And you end up with an output grouped by the type of animal:

{
    'cat': [
        'Fluffy',
        'Oreo',
        'Bella'
    ],
    'dog': [
        'Roxie',
        'Zeus',
        'Spike',
        'Scooby'
    ]
}

The answers in this StackOverflow question were immensely helpful and saved me a lot of time when trying to figure out how to group data in the most Pythonic way.
Removing Duplicates in a List

A quick and easy one liner to remove duplicates from a list in Python (order is not maintained):

x = [1, 8, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 8]
list(set(x))

This method leverages the fact that a set is a collection of distinct objects. However, a set does not maintain order, so if the order of the objects matter to you, use the technique below instead:

from collections import OrderedDict
x = [1, 8, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 8]
list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(x))

Access the Index of a Python For Loop

This may be common knowledge to a lot of you but it's asked quite regularly. Python's built-in enumerate function gives you access to the index and value like so:

x = [1, 8, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 8]
for index, value in enumerate(x):
    print(index, value)

You can change the start index by specifying the start parameter to the enumerate function:

x = [1, 8, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 8]
for index, value in enumerate(x, start=1):
    print(index, value)

Now the index will go from 1 to 9 instead of 0 to 8
Iterating Over 2 Collections in Parallel

Use the built-in zip function to iterate over 2 lists, dictionaries, etc... at the same time. Here's an example of using the zip function on 2 lists:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
for (a_val, b_val) in zip(a, b):
    print(a_val, b_val)

Will output:

1 4
2 5
3 6

Creating a Copy of Objects

You can copy an object in Python using the generic copy functions. A shallow copy is done using the copy.copy call:

import copy
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)

For a deep copy:

import copy
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)

This StackOverflow Question gives a good explanation of the various methods for copying a list. If you're unfamiliar with the differences between a shallow copy and a deep copy have a look at this explanation.
Floating Point Division

You can ensure floating point division by casting either the numerator or denominatior to a float:

answer = a/float(b)

Convert a String to a Date and a Date to a String

A common task is to convert a string to a datetime object. This is easily done using the strptime method:

from datetime import datetime
date_obj = datetime.strptime('May 29 2015  2:45PM', '%B %d %Y %I:%M%p')

For the inverse operation, that is converting datetime object to a formatted string, use the strftime method on a datetime object:

from datetime import datetime
date_obj = datetime.now()
date_string = date_obj.strftime('%B %d %Y %I:%M%p')

For a list of format codes and what they do, check out the official docs
Parsing a JSON file and Writing an Object to a JSON file

You can parse a JSON file and construct a Python object out of it using the load function. Assume we have a JSON file called data.json that contains the following data:

{
    "dog": {
        "lives": 1,
        "breeds": [
            "Border Collie",
            "Pit Bull",
            "Huskie"
        ]
    },
    "cat": {
        "lives": 9,
        "breeds": [
            "Siamese",
            "Persian",
            "Sphynx"
        ]
    }
}

import json
with open('data.json') as input_file:
    data = json.load(input_file)

data is now an object that you can manipulate as you normally would with any Python object:

print(data['cat']['lives'])
output: 9

To write a Python dictionary to a JSON file, you can use the dump method:

import json

data = {'dog': {'legs': 4, 'breeds': ['Border Collie', 'Pit Bull', 'Huskie']}, 'cat': {'legs': 4, 'breeds': ['Siamese', 'Persian', 'Sphynx']}}

with open('data.json', 'w') as output_file:
    json.dump(data, output_file, indent=4)

The indent parameter pretty prints the JSON string so that the output is easier to read. In this case we're specifying 4 spaces.
